## Issues encounter

### Technicals issues

1. NPC creation is too difficult to build up and longer than i excepted.
> The NPC is now the last feature of the project, because the feature is too hard and others features is much important than the NPC.

2. When the texture is apply to the map, the PC loose high performance and do an hard consumption of the GPU.
>  Reduce the performance of the engine to save the GPU.

### Non-technicals challenges

3. Loose my Motivation, my longing and moral.
> Play with Nathan and my friends

## Collaboration

I share the progression of my game to Adrien and Nathan, and they tell me what features is interresting and the next Friday we worked together to create audio for my game.

## Project Updates

NPC feature is now optionnal and see at the end of the project if i implement the NPC or not.

## Progress

### Scale Progression

8/10

### Why this scale

1. Because, 2 features of the last week is not complete and go in optionnal features (NPC and Quests).
2. But, the feature to create the map is done 4 days before the date of the release.
3. I didn't worked Friday and i write this page challenges with 3/4 days of late.

### Solution

Have a better motivation !
